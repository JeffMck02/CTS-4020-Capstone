  <h1>About the Project</h1>

<p class="subtitle">
  My Project is a digital humanities capstone research project that explores how food functions as a means of creating and preserving culture, memory and a sense of identity. I draw on food studies, anthropology, oral history and cultural theory along with interviews with local chefs and community members to understand how food and culinary practices contribute to preserving, adapting and communicating cultural knowledge across different cultures and generations. The project will be hosted on a HTML website I design, where interview pieces are placed in combination with my academic research, where the website functions as a way of linking lived experience of my interview subjects with scholarly analysis.

    <h2>Project Background</h2>

    <p>
      Food was a core part of my upbringing and has always been something I use to understand the world, as I grow older and have had more experiences around the world i've been amazed at how food is almost always at the forefront of the culture's of new places, whether its the way they enjoy food, the food itself, or the people creating it. This is what inspired my project, and this is why I want to understand how exactly food contributes to culture and the memories that form becasue of it.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>


    <p>
      My project uses qualitative, oral history based research to investigate and gain insight on my research questions. Oral history is well suited for this project and topic because it emphasizes lived experience, storytelling and interpretation of personal experiences and meaning. My project treats chefs as holders of unique knowledge whose stories and experiences reveal cultural processes that are embodied, sensory in nature and present in our everyday lives.
